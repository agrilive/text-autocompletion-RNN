      "if the legislature indicates that it will not pas the mou socal would likely file for voluntary bankruptcy or its creditor involuntary due to the lack operating cash\n",
      "the second likely triggering event which is linked directly to the bond issuance would be an effort by senator bowen to amend sb bridge loan stating that the dwr would received of its payments from ratepayers then the utilities would receive the residual amount\n",
      "in other words the state will get paid before the utilities\n",
      "if this language is included and passed by the legislature it appears likely that socal will likely file for bankruptcy\n",

      "your intuition as to reductions seen so far e g march vs march was absolutely correct\n",
      "at this point it appears that demand over the last months in the caiso control area after adjusting for temperature and time of use factors has fallen by about\n",
      "this translates into a reduction of about mwa for last month march as compared with the previous year looking forward into the summer i believe that we will see further voluntary reductions as opposed to forced reductions via rolling blackouts\n",
      "other forecasters e g pira are estimating that another mwa making total year_on_year reduction will come off starting in june\n",
      "this scenario is not difficult to imagine as it would require only a couple more percentage points reduction in overall peak demand\n",
      "given that the decrease we have seen so far has come without any real price signals to the retail market and that rates are now scheduled to increase i think that it is possible we could see peak demand fall by as much as relative to last year\n",
      "this would mean peak demand reductions of approx mwa in jun_aug\n",
      "in addition a number of efforts aimed specifically at conservation are being promoted by the state which can only increase the likelihood of meeting and perhaps exceeding the mwa figure\n",
      "finally the general economic slowdown in calif could also further depress demand or at least make the mwa number that much more attainable note that all the numbers i am reporting here are for the caiso control area only which represents about of total calif load or of wscc u s summer load\n",
      "i think it is reasonable to assume that the non_iso portion of calif i e ladwp and iid will see similar reductions in demand\n",
      "as for the rest of the wscc that is a much more difficult call\n",
      "as you are aware the pacific nw has already seen about mwa of aluminum smelter load come off since dec and this load is expected to stay off at least through sep and possibly for the next couple of years if bpa gets its wish\n",
      "this figure represents approx of the non_calif wscc\n",
      "several mining operations in the sw and rockies have recently announced that they are sharply curtailing production\n",
      "i have not yet been able to pin down exactly how many mw this translates to but i will continue to research the issue\n",
      "other large industrials may follow suit and the ripple effects from califs economic slowdown could be a factor throughout the west\n",
      "while the rest of the wscc may not see the reductions that i am expecting in calif i think we could easily expect an additional on top of the already realized or approx mwa of further demand reduction in the non_calif wscc for this summer\n",
      "this would bring the total reduction for the wscc including the mwa aluminum load we have already seen to around mwa when compared with last summer i am continuing to research and monitor the situation and will provide you with updates as new or better information becomes available\n",

      "many legislative republicans and democrats reportedly do not trust davis and express concern that once the bonds are issued to replenish the general fund davis would double dip into the fund\n",
      "clearly there is a lack of good faith between the legislature and the governor\n",
      "however it is believed once davis discloses the details of the power contracts negotiated a bond issuance will take place\n",
      "additionally some generator sources have reported that some of the long_term power contracts as opposed to those still in development require that the bond issuance happen by july\n",
      "if not the state may be in breach of contract\n",
      "sources state that if the legislature does not pass the bridge loan legislation by may having a bond issuance by july will be very difficult the republicans were planning to offer an alternative plan whereby the state would eat the billion cost of power spent to date out of the general fund thereby decreasing the amount of the bond issuance to approximately billion\n",
      "however the reportedly now are not going to offer even this concession\n",
      "sources report that the republicans intend to hold out for full disclosure of the governors plan for handling the crisis including the details and terms of all long_term contracts he has negotiated before they will support the bond issuance to go forward currently there are two bills dealing with the bridge loan ab and ab\n",
      "ab authorizes the dwr to sell up to billion in bonds\n",
      "this bill passed the senate in march but has stalled in the assembly due to a lack of republican support\n",
      "ab deals with energy conservation programs for community college districts\n",
      "however sources report this bill may be amended to include language relevant to the bond sale by senator bowen currently in ab\n",
      "senator bowens language states that the state should get paid before the utilities from rate payments which if passed would be likely to cause a socal bankruptcy\n",
      "according to sources close to the republicans in the legislature republicans do not believe there should be a bridge loan due to money available in the general fund\n",
      "for instance tony strickland has stated that only of the bonds or approximately billion should be issued\n",
      "other republicans reportedly do not support issuing any bonds\n",
      "the republicans intend to bring this up in debate on monday\n",
      "additionally lehman brothers reportedly also feels that a bridge loan is unnecessary and there are some indications that lehman may back out of the bridge loan\n",
      "key points of the bridge financinginitial loan amount blenders jp morgan b lehman brothers b bear stearns mtax exempt portion of the b b is expected to be tax_exemptprojected interest rate taxable rate tax_exempt rate projected blended ir date august more details please contact me at sb passed the senate yesterday but little can be done at this timethe senate passed sb yesterday which authorizes billion to create the california consumer power and conservation authority\n",
      "the billion authorized under sb is not the same as the billion that must be authorized by the legislature to pay for power already purchased or the additional amount of bonds that must be authorized to pay for purchasing power going forward\n",
      "again the republicans are not in support of these authorizations\n",
      "without the details of the long_term power contracts the governor has negotiated the republicans do not know what the final bond amount is that must be issued and that taxpayers will have to pay to support\n",
      "no further action can be taken regarding the implementation of sb until it is clarified how and when the state and the utilities get paid for purchasing power\n",
      "also there is no staff defined purpose etc\n",
      "for the california public power and conservation authority\n",
      "however this can be considered a victory for consumer advocates who began promoting this idea earlier in the crisis\n",
      "socal edison and bankruptcyat this point two events would be likely to trigger a socal bankruptcy\n",
      "the first would be a legislative rejection of the mou between socal and the governor\n",
      "the specified deadline for legislative approval of the mou is august however some decision will likely be made earlier\n",
      "according to sources the state has yet to sign the mou with socal though socal has signed it\n",
      "the republicans are against the mou in its current form and davis and the senate lack the votes needed to pass\n",
      "if the legislature indicates that it will not pas the mou socal would likely file for voluntary bankruptcy or its creditor involuntary due to the lack operating cash\n",
      "the second likely triggering event which is linked directly to the bond issuance would be an effort by senator bowen to amend sb bridge loan stating that the dwr would received of its payments from ratepayers then the utilities would receive the residual amount\n",
      "in other words the state will get paid before the utilities\n",
      "if this language is included and passed by the legislature it appears likely that socal will likely file for bankruptcy\n",
      "socal is urging the legislature to pay both the utilities and the dwr proportionately from rate payments\n",

      "your intuition as to reductions seen so far e g march vs march was absolutely correct\n",
      "at this point it appears that demand over the last months in the caiso control area after adjusting for temperature and time of use factors has fallen by about\n",
      "this translates into a reduction of about mwa for last month march as compared with the previous year looking forward into the summer i believe that we will see further voluntary reductions as opposed to forced reductions via rolling blackouts\n",
      "other forecasters e g pira are estimating that another mwa making total year_on_year reduction will come off starting in june\n",
      "this scenario is not difficult to imagine as it would require only a couple more percentage points reduction in overall peak demand\n",
      "given that the decrease we have seen so far has come without any real price signals to the retail market and that rates are now scheduled to increase i think that it is possible we could see peak demand fall by as much as relative to last year\n",
      "this would mean peak demand reductions of approx mwa in jun_aug\n",
      "in addition a number of efforts aimed specifically at conservation are being promoted by the state which can only increase the likelihood of meeting and perhaps exceeding the mwa figure\n",
      "finally the general economic slowdown in calif could also further depress demand or at least make the mwa number that much more attainable note that all the numbers i am reporting here are for the caiso control area only which represents about of total calif load or of wscc u s summer load\n",
      "i think it is reasonable to assume that the non_iso portion of calif i e ladwp and iid will see similar reductions in demand\n",
      "as for the rest of the wscc that is a much more difficult call\n",
      "as you are aware the pacific nw has already seen about mwa of aluminum smelter load come off since dec and this load is expected to stay off at least through sep and possibly for the next couple of years if bpa gets its wish\n",
      "this figure represents approx of the non_calif wscc\n",
      "several mining operations in the sw and rockies have recently announced that they are sharply curtailing production\n",
      "i have not yet been able to pin down exactly how many mw this translates to but i will continue to research the issue\n",
      "other large industrials may follow suit and the ripple effects from califs economic slowdown could be a factor throughout the west\n",
      "while the rest of the wscc may not see the reductions that i am expecting in calif i think we could easily expect an additional on top of the already realized or approx mwa of further demand reduction in the non_calif wscc for this summer\n",
      "this would bring the total reduction for the wscc including the mwa aluminum load we have already seen to around mwa when compared with last summer i am continuing to research and monitor the situation and will provide you with updates as new or better information becomes available\n",

      "spent over an hour and a half with us covering our suggestions and his ideas\n",

      "below are my notes from the meeting regarding our proposals the governors ideas as well as my overview of the situation based on the governors commentsoverview we made great progress in both ensuring that he understands that we are different from the generators and in opening a channel for ongoing communication with his administration\n",
      "the gov does not want the utilities to go bankrupt and seems predisposed to both rate relief more modest than what the utilities are looking for and credit guarantees\n",
      "his staff has more work to do on the latter but he was clearly intrigued with the idea\n",
      "he talked mainly in terms of raising rates but not uncapping them at the retail level\n",
      "he also wants to use what generation he has control over for the benefit of california consumers including utility_owned generation which he would dedicate to consumers on a cost_plus basis and excess muni power which he estimates at\n",
      "he foresees a mix of market oriented solutions as well as interventionist solutions which will allow him to fix the problem by and provide some political cover our proposals i have attached the outline we put in front of him it also included the forward price information several of you provided\n",
      "he seemed interested in the buy down of significant demand the state setting a goal of mw of new generation by a date certain getting the utilities to gradually buy more power forward and setting up a group of rate analysts and other nonadvocates to develop solutions to a number of issues including designing the portfolio and forward purchase terms for utilities\n",
      "he was also quite interested in examining the incentives surrounding ldc gas purchases\n",
      "as already mentioned he was also favorably disposed to finding some state sponsored credit support for the utilities his ideas the gov read from a list of ideas some of which were obviously under serious consideration and some of which were mere brainstorming\n",
      "some of these ideas would require legislative action state may build or make buildtransfer arrangements a couple of generation plants\n",
      "the gov feels strongly that he has to show consumers that they are getting something in return for bearing some rate increases\n",
      "this was a frequently recurring theme utilities would sell the output from generation they still own on a cost_plus basis to consumers municipal utilties would be required to sell their excess generation in california state universities including uccsu and the community colleges would more widely deploy distributed generation expand in_state gas production take state lands gas royalties in kind negotiate directly with tribes and state governments in the west for addtional gas supplies empower an existing state agency to approvecoordinate power plant maintenance schedules to avoid having too much generation out of service at any one time condition emissions offsets on commitments to sell power longer term in state either eliminate the iso or sharply curtail its function he wants to hear more about how nordpool worksjeff someone in schroeders group should be able to help out here wants to condition new generation on a commitment to sell in state\n",
      "we made some headway with the idea that he could instead require utilities to buy some portion of their forward requirements from new in_state generation thereby accomplishing the same thing without using a command and control approach with generators securitize uncollected power purchase costs to dos jeff again i would like to prevail on you to assemble the groups thoughts and get them to karihe wants to see year fixed power prices for peak off_peak and baseload not just the one year strips he wants comments on his proposals by tuesday he would like thoughts on how to pitch what consumers are getting out of the deal he wants to assemble a group of energy gurus to help sort through some of the forward contracting issues thanks to everyone for their help\n",

      "your intuition as to reductions seen so far e g march vs march was absolutely correct\n",
      "at this point it appears that demand over the last months in the caiso control area after adjusting for temperature and time of use factors has fallen by about\n",
      "this translates into a reduction of about mwa for last month march as compared with the previous year looking forward into the summer i believe that we will see further voluntary reductions as opposed to forced reductions via rolling blackouts\n",
      "other forecasters e g pira are estimating that another mwa making total year_on_year reduction will come off starting in june\n",
      "this scenario is not difficult to imagine as it would require only a couple more percentage points reduction in overall peak demand\n",
      "given that the decrease we have seen so far has come without any real price signals to the retail market and that rates are now scheduled to increase i think that it is possible we could see peak demand fall by as much as relative to last year\n",
      "this would mean peak demand reductions of approx mwa in jun_aug\n",
      "in addition a number of efforts aimed specifically at conservation are being promoted by the state which can only increase the likelihood of meeting and perhaps exceeding the mwa figure\n",
      "finally the general economic slowdown in calif could also further depress demand or at least make the mwa number that much more attainable note that all the numbers i am reporting here are for the caiso control area only which represents about of total calif load or of wscc u s summer load\n",
      "i think it is reasonable to assume that the non_iso portion of calif i e ladwp and iid will see similar reductions in demand\n",
      "as for the rest of the wscc that is a much more difficult call\n",
      "as you are aware the pacific nw has already seen about mwa of aluminum smelter load come off since dec and this load is expected to stay off at least through sep and possibly for the next couple of years if bpa gets its wish\n",
      "this figure represents approx of the non_calif wscc\n",
      "several mining operations in the sw and rockies have recently announced that they are sharply curtailing production\n",
      "i have not yet been able to pin down exactly how many mw this translates to but i will continue to research the issue\n",
      "other large industrials may follow suit and the ripple effects from califs economic slowdown could be a factor throughout the west\n",
      "while the rest of the wscc may not see the reductions that i am expecting in calif i think we could easily expect an additional on top of the already realized or approx mwa of further demand reduction in the non_calif wscc for this summer\n",
      "this would bring the total reduction for the wscc including the mwa aluminum load we have already seen to around mwa when compared with last summer i am continuing to research and monitor the situation and will provide you with updates as new or better information becomes available\n",

      "instead they look like a signficant stranded cost hertzberg and the negotiating group are looking to enron for creative ways to address the dwr contract problem in order to prevent the contracts from killing the corenoncore deal and forcing california to accept a structure focused on a state power authority headed_up by david freeman that does not include direct access christian yoder and steve hall are reviewing the contracts to analyze any out clauses that the buyer andor the seller might have under the contract provisions\n",
      "my cursory review of the contracts suggests that outs for the state are minimal or nonexistent\n",
      "in addition we have started batting around ideas about how the state might reform the contracts all this said want to let everyone know that we have made it extremely clear that enron fundamentally opposes any and all attempts to unilaterally abrogate anyones contract rights we would like to have a quick call tomorrow minutes to brainstorm some options that we can offer hertzberg to handle the contracts and keep the corenoncore solution alive\n",
      "we would like to try to have the the call at pm pdt\n",
      "please let me know if this works for you and if it does not please let me know if there is a time after pm pdt that works for you thanksjeff\n",
